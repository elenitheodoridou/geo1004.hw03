Assignment 3 - Processing a BIM model using CSG

Authors: Eleni Theodoridou, Fabian Visser, Guilherme Spinoza Andreo

## What does the code do?
**TO DO**

(i) Need to describe all files submitted, and (ii) tell us how to run the code. Provide enough instructions so that we can generate exactly the CityJSON file uploaded from the OBJ files submitted.

## How to build from command line

The repository is public and available to be cloned.
This code was executed using Clion IDE (Build #CL-213.6777.58) 2021.3.3

Check and edit the CMakelists.txt, so that it is able to find the libraries of their relative paths 

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/guispinoza/geo1004.hw03
    $ cd geo1004.hw03/hw/03/cpp
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ ./hw03
  
```
Or you can download with the zip file, extract and run:
```
    $ cd https://github.com/guispinoza/geo1004.hw03.git/hw/03/cpp
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ ./hw03

```
